Once you have designed your own Carrera race track with Autorennbahnplaner.zip, you might want to learn some tips and tricks to improve your slot car racing skills. Slot car racing is a fun and exciting hobby that requires practice, patience and strategy. Here are some of the best tips and tricks we found from various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] to help you become a better slot car racer:
 
- Clean your track and car tires regularly. Dust and debris can affect the traction and performance of your cars. Use a Swiffer wipe or a lint tape roll to remove any dust from the track surface and the car tires. Use canned air to blow out any dust from the track slot and the car guides.
- Adjust your car's magnet. Most Carrera slot cars have a magnet underneath that helps them stick to the track. However, too much magnet can make your car too heavy and slow down its speed. You can adjust the magnet by moving it closer or farther away from the track, or by adding or removing spacers. Experiment with different magnet settings until you find the optimal balance between grip and speed.
- Practice your throttle control. One of the most important skills in slot car racing is knowing when to accelerate and when to brake. You don't want to go full throttle all the time, as this will make your car fly off the track on sharp curves. You also don't want to brake too hard or too late, as this will make you lose momentum and time. Learn to modulate your throttle according to the shape and length of each curve, and try to maintain a smooth and consistent speed throughout the lap.
- Plan your overtaking moves. If you are racing against other cars, you need to be strategic about when and how to overtake them. You can't just ram them off the track, as this will damage your car and cause a crash. You also can't just follow them closely, as this will make you lose speed and waste time. You need to look for opportunities to pass them on the straights or on the inside of the curves, where there is more space and less risk of collision. You also need to anticipate their moves and react accordingly.
- Have fun and enjoy the hobby. Slot car racing is not only about winning or losing, but also about having fun and enjoying the hobby. You can customize your cars, build your own tracks, join clubs and competitions, or just race for fun with your friends and family. Slot car racing is a great way to relax, unwind and have some excitement in your life.

We hope these tips and tricks will help you improve your slot car racing skills and have more fun with your Carrera race track. If you want more information or inspiration, you can check out some of the best slot car track plans online[^2^] [^3^] or buy a book on slot car racing. Happy racing!
