The film begins with a young Akbar being crowned as the emperor of the Mughal empire after his father's death. He is advised by his regent Bairam Khan to marry a Rajput princess to strengthen his alliance with the Hindu kingdoms. Akbar agrees and chooses Jodhaa, the daughter of King Bharmal of Amer. Jodhaa is reluctant to marry a Muslim ruler, but agrees to do so for the sake of her people. She also makes a condition that she will retain her Hindu faith and customs after marriage.
  
Akbar and Jodhaa have a rocky start to their relationship, as they have different beliefs and backgrounds. However, they gradually develop respect and admiration for each other, and eventually fall in love. Akbar also becomes a tolerant and benevolent ruler, who respects all religions and cultures in his empire. He abolishes the tax on non-Muslims and grants them equal rights. He also builds a new capital city called Fatehpur Sikri, where he invites scholars, artists, and poets from different faiths to enrich his court.
  
However, not everyone is happy with Akbar's policies and reforms. His brother-in-law Sharifuddin Hussain plots to assassinate him with the help of some disgruntled nobles and Rajputs. He also tries to incite a rebellion among the Hindus by spreading rumors that Akbar is forcing them to convert to Islam. One of the rebels is Sujamal, Jodhaa's cousin, who feels betrayed by her marriage to Akbar. He joins Sharifuddin's army and attacks Akbar's camp. Akbar manages to defeat the rebels with the help of Jodhaa, who proves her loyalty and courage by fighting alongside him. The film ends with Akbar and Jodhaa celebrating their victory and love in Fatehpur Sikri.
